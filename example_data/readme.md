# Test Data

The data provided here to test the GUI consist of the first five frames of the dataset 9 provided by the Yeast Image Toolkit. They were registered in the Doncic Lab by N Ezgi Wood and Orlando Arg√ºello-Miranda [1]. We deliberately don't provide data from our own lab (on which the neural network was trained) to demonstrate that our method generalizes well to different microscopy conditions.
